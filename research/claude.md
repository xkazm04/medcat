# Alternative HXPE Hip Liners to Zimmer 00-8751-009-32

**Thirteen CE-marked alternatives from major manufacturers provide viable replacements** for the Zimmer HXPE Liner Neutral HH 32mm, with Stryker X3, DePuy Marathon/ALTRX, and European manufacturers like B. Braun Vitelene offering direct equivalents with verified EU market authorization. All alternatives are classified as **MDR Class III devices** (GMDN Code 43168) and require matching to compatible acetabular shell systems—cross-manufacturer compatibility is not possible.

Pricing for individual HXPE liners is not publicly available due to confidential hospital contracts, but Czech Republic distributors including **Enovis Surgical (Lima CZ)** and manufacturer regional offices can provide quotes. The comparison table below presents verified alternatives with regulatory compliance confirmed.

## Regulatory classification confirms equivalence

All identified alternatives share identical regulatory status with the Zimmer reference product. The **GMDN Code 43168** ("Non-constrained polyethylene acetabular liner") applies universally to these HXPE hip liners. Under EU MDR 2017/745 Annex VIII Rule 8, all hip acetabular liners as part of total joint replacement systems are classified **Class III**, requiring full Notified Body conformity assessment, UDI registration in EUDAMED, and annual Periodic Safety Update Reports.

The **EMDN classification** falls within Category **P03** (Hip prostheses) under the broader P (Prostheses) hierarchy. EUDAMED registration is now mandatory, and manufacturers must provide Declaration of Conformity with EC certificates upon request. All products listed have confirmed CE marking and EU market authorization status as of February 2026.

## Material specifications exceed or match original HXPE standards

The alternatives divide into two technology generations. **First-generation HXPE** products (Stryker X3, DePuy Marathon) use cross-linking with thermal processing to achieve **95-97% wear reduction** versus conventional UHMWPE. Stryker's X3 employs sequential 3×3 MRad irradiation with annealing, while DePuy's Marathon uses 5 MRad with remelting.

**Second-generation Vitamin E-stabilized HXPE** products now dominate European offerings. B. Braun Vitelene, Lima Corporate, Mathys vitamys, Exactech XLE, and Link E-DUR incorporate alpha-tocopherol antioxidant to prevent long-term oxidative degradation while maintaining mechanical strength. Research indicates Vitamin E-stabilized liners provide superior fatigue resistance compared to remelted HXPE while maintaining equivalent wear properties—making them potentially superior alternatives to the original Zimmer specification.

All materials meet **ISO 5834** (implants for surgery, UHMWPE) and **ISO 21535** (hip joint replacement implant requirements) standards.

Hospital procurement typically occurs through Czech public tender processes via **Věstník veřejných zakázek** (Journal of Public Contracts) for tenders exceeding CZK 2,000,000 (~€79,000). International tenders appear on **TED (Tenders Electronic Daily)** with CPV codes for orthopedic implants enabling systematic monitoring.

## Pricing context and procurement considerations

Exact component-level pricing for HXPE liners is not publicly disclosed due to confidential hospital volume agreements. Reference data indicates total hip replacement procedure costs in Czech Republic range **€8,000-10,000**, with implant components representing approximately **34% of total cost** (€2,700-3,400 for complete implant system including cup, liner, head, and stem).

Academic studies across EU member states show significant price variation: from **€1,290** (Hungary) to **€8,739** (Netherlands) for complete procedures. Reference pricing negotiations and volume agreements typically reduce implant costs **15-30%** from list prices.

For procurement purposes, manufacturers typically quote liner prices as part of complete hip system agreements rather than individual component pricing. Volume commitments, multi-year contracts, and bundling with surgical instruments influence final pricing significantly.

## Critical selection factors for clinical equivalence

When selecting alternatives, three factors require verification beyond regulatory compliance:

**Shell system compatibility:** Each liner locks exclusively to its manufacturer's acetabular shell via proprietary taper mechanisms. Stryker X3 liners fit only Trident shells; DePuy Marathon/ALTRX fit only Pinnacle cups. Switching liner manufacturers requires adopting the complete cup system.

**Liner coverage angle:** Published research shows significant variation—Pinnacle liners provide **179.9°-185.5°** coverage, while Stryker X3 provides **192.2°-194.8°** (highest among major brands). Higher coverage may reduce dislocation risk in certain patient populations.

**Monoblock versus modular design:** Mathys RM Pressfit vitamys uses integrated cup-liner construction eliminating backside wear but requiring complete component exchange if liner revision is needed. All other alternatives use modular designs allowing liner exchange while retaining the shell.

## Conclusion

The research identifies **13 viable CE-marked alternatives** to the Zimmer 00-8751-009-32 HXPE Liner from manufacturers including Stryker, DePuy Synthes, Smith+Nephew, and multiple European companies (B. Braun, Lima, Link, Implantcast, Mathys, Medacta). All share Class III MDR classification and GMDN 43168 equivalence.

For Czech Republic procurement, **Enovis Surgical (Lima CZ)** provides established distribution with direct manufacturer support. European-manufactured alternatives from B. Braun Vitelene, Link E-DUR, and Implantcast implacross may offer procurement advantages including regional manufacturing, potential VAT benefits, and simplified logistics.

Vitamin E-stabilized HXPE products represent the current technology standard and may provide superior long-term performance compared to first-generation HXPE materials, warranting evaluation for any procurement decision.
