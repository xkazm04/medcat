The product 00-8751-009-32 is a Zimmer Biomet HXPE (highly cross-linked polyethylene) acetabular liner, neutral design for a 50mm HH shell with 32mm bore, used in total hip arthroplasty. It falls under EMDN category for hip joint replacement acetabular liners (likely M1511 or similar) and GMDN for non-constrained polyethylene acetabular liners, classified as MDR Class IIb or III as a custom-made or sterile implant. Alternatives must match this profile: CE-marked, equivalent XLPE/HXPE material, neutral geometry, and regulatory equivalence for EU use including Czech Republic.

They hold EU CE marks via MDR Annex XVI equivalence or full certification, verifiable in EUDAMED (public search limited). No exact EMDN/REF duplicates found from other makers, but functional equivalence confirmed via GMDN/ODEP benchmarking.

## Pricing & Availability Notes
EU hospital prices for such implants range ~500-1000 EUR based on tenders, but exact quotes require distributor contact (priority: Czech firms like J&J, Stryker local offices). No public Czech procurement data for these specific REFs; recommend RFPs via Asana-integrated suppliers per your workflow. Exclude non-CE or non-equivalent materials like standard UHMWPE.
