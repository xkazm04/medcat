## Analysis of Equivalency

### 1. Material Properties

The Zimmer Longevity® HXPE is the industry benchmark for low wear. The **Stryker X3®** and **B. Braun Vitamin E** variants are considered "superior" or "next-gen" alternatives. Vitamin E infused liners (like the B. Braun Plasmafit or Zimmer's own Vivacit-E) offer enhanced oxidative stability, which can be critical for younger, active patients in the Czech market.

### 2. Market Availability in Czech Republic

* **Zimmer Biomet** and **Stryker** have the strongest distribution networks in the Czech Republic, with dedicated local entities and logistics hubs.
* **B. Braun** is highly prevalent in Central Europe and often preferred in regional tenders due to their integrated surgical system approach.

### 3. Regulatory Equivalence

All listed alternatives share the **GMDN 43168** nomenclature. Under MDR (EU 2017/745), any substitution must be verified against the specific **Shell (Cup) compatibility**. Acetabular liners are system-specific; while the *material* is equivalent, the *locking mechanism* requires the corresponding manufacturer's shell.
